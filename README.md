## Overview

### The Challenge

Discover peace of mind with Insure. Our landing page highlights our comprehensive insurance services, tailored to protect you and your loved ones.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5(designing the basic layout)
- CSS3(Styling it using properties like flexbox, grid, hover states etc)
- Vanilla JavaScript(for implementing dynamic functionalities of the webpage)

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

- Crafting a visually compelling and informative landing page
- Implementing responsive design techniques for optimal viewing on all devices
- Enhancing user engagement through interactive elements and hover states

Here is the code snippet that I am proud of-

```js
if (window.matchMedia('(max-width: 767px)').matches) {
    $('.dropdown-content').hide();
}
$(document).ready(function () {

    // jQuery methods go here...

    $('.dropbtn').click(function () {

        $('.dropdown-content').slideToggle(800, function () {
            if ($('.dropbtn').attr('src') == 'images/icon-hamburger.svg')
                $(".dropbtn").attr("src", "images/icon-close.svg");
            else if ($('.dropbtn').attr('src') == 'images/icon-close.svg')
                $(".dropbtn").attr("src", "images/icon-hamburger.svg");


        });
    })

    $(window).resize(function () {
        if ($(window).width() > 768) {
            $('.dropdown-content').removeAttr('style');
        }
    });

});
```

### Continued Development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.

- Adding interactive features like live chat support
- Integrating customer testimonials for social proof
- Improving SEO to increase organic traffic
